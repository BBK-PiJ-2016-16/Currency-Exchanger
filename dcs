    Bug: euro -> pound conversion was broken. FIXED.
    
    The variables did not have the right names. This is one of the dangers
    of carelessly copy-pasting code.
    
    Mental note: be more careful when copy-pasting code, even with
    trivially simple programs for lectures.

    Removed string variable str.
    
    It was not adding clarity to the code. It was used always in the same
    way: read a string, then parse it. We do not need an intermediate
    variable for it.
    
    The usual reason for introducing a new variable is either:
    
    a) To make the code clearer. This happens when the variable's name
      refers to an important concept like 'euroToPoundsRatio',
      'databaseConnection', or any other partial result.
    
    b) To make the code faster. This happens when the variable holds the
      result of some intermediate computation that is expensive and you
      should not perform the same computation several times but just once,
      e.g. fixed-rate interest payment calculations over several months,
      word-counting over the same text, reading the same web page from a
      network connection, etc.
    
    Neither of these conditions is true in this case, so I delete the
    variable to make the code shorter (shorter code is clearer, provided
    all other factors are equal).

    Minor bug fixes:
      - Added a space in println so the program's output looks nicer.
      - Added empty line inside loop so the program's output looks nicer.

    Main loop added to the program.
    
    Next step: implement conversion.

    Better not to use println here,
    so that the cursor stays on the same line.

    First commit. Just a couple of lines.
